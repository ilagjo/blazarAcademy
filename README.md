During March - April 2023, I attended the Full-Stack Development Academy at Blazar Group. 
This was my first experience in an IT consulting firm and I had the opportunity to strengthen my front-end development skills, as well as to learn about back-end development. 
The core technologies and languages covered in the program included .NET C#, SQL Server Management Studio, Git, JavaScript, Three.js, Webpack, Angular, Material UI.

These repository includes the assignments from the front-end development lessons.
